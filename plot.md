# Who R U?

SPOILERS

## 01 Ready to Return
cabbage.dat

We have sufficient energy crystals to get back home, but for some reason we can't get a lock on the last few miners.
We need you to go and get them and find out what is going on.

- add crystal pyramids
- add messages noting mysterious energy field

## 02 Extended Exploration
a_bridge_too_far.dat

We've lost a tool store near another one of those mysterious signatures.
We can't afford to leave our gear behind, and we need to get to the bottom of these signatures inhibiting our teleporters.
Wile you find the lost tool store and investigate the signatures, also try to pick up some energy crystals.

- add rock monster "chappel"
- add messages noting monster congreation

## 03 Cramped Canal
cramped.dat

We traced the rock monsters congreation down a narrow passage but then lost track of them.
To trace the passage further down we need you to establish a strong teleporter signature by constructing a super teleporter.

- add some crystal recharge seams

## 04 Energy Ethnography
unwilling_worker.dat

By using the super teleporter as a relay we were able to locate a cavern with an almost church like structure full of rock monsters.
We need you to study their behaviour and get a few crystals for station upkeep if you can.

- make more churchlike
- add "flickering" rock

## 05 Lava Labyrinth
labyrinth.dat

Our scanners have traced that bit of misbehaving rock to a whole cave of misbehaving rock!
Be careful Cadet, this cave seems to be filled with constantly changing erosion.
Find out what is going on, and collect some energy crystals.

- reinforce that the rock monsters seem to be messing with us

## 06 Dimensional Drift
dimensional_rift.dat

We seem to be getting closer to the source of the mystery, but two miners we sent down to explore vanished without a trace.
We'll send you down with some heavy machinery to get to the bottom of this.
Find the lost miners, and figure out where this leads!

## 07 Monster Mansion
lights_out.dat

This is it Cadet, we've located the HQ of the rock monsters.
The cave is extremely symmetrical and rich in crystals, but the walls seem to regenerate as soon as they are drilled.
We need you to find a way to drill those resources, and finally find out what is going on here.
