### Briefing

We've lost a tool store near another one of those mysterious signatures.

Wile you find the lost tool store and investigate the signatures, also try to pick up some energy crystals.

### TODO

### Briefing

We traced the rock monsters congreation down a narrow passage but then lost track of them.
To trace the passage further down we need you to establish a strong teleporter signature by constructing a super teleporter.

### TODO
- add some crystal recharge seams

### Gameplay

build a starting base to build something that can cross lava, then dig out the other side and relocate your toolstore there, get a small driller and drill the hard rock. Then let the erosion destroy part of a building, clear the erosion and use the extra tile to squeeze in a super teleporter.

## 04 Energy Ethnography

You need to lure rock monsters to carry energy crystals to your base without making them run away.
