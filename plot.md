# Who R U?

SPOILERS

## 01 Ready to Return
cabbage.dat

### Briefing
We have sufficient Energy Crystals to get back home, but for some reason we can't get a lock on the last few miners. There's some kind of mysterious energy field interfering with our teleporter systems.

We need you to go and retrieve them and find out what is going on. The miners are stranded across an underground river with limited transport options available.

### Success
You managed to retrieve all the missing miners despite the transport challenges. That mysterious energy signature is still concerning though. Mission complete.

### Failure
You didn't manage to retrieve all the stranded miners. We can't leave without them! Mission failed.

### Messages
string m1="Strange energy readings detected. Our teleporters seem to be malfunctioning."
string m2="Good thinking! You found a way across the river."

### TODO
- add crystal pyramids
- add messages noting mysterious energy field

### Gameplay
miners are on the other side of a river. With limited resources you have to find a way to pick them up.
Inspired by the classic goat, cabbage, wolf puzzle, but with rock raiders vehicles.

## 02 Extended Exploration
a_bridge_too_far.dat

### Briefing
We've lost a Tool Store near another one of those mysterious energy signatures. Our teleporters are still experiencing interference in that area.

We can't afford to leave our equipment behind, and we need to get to the bottom of these signatures. While you recover the lost Tool Store and investigate, try to collect some Energy Crystals as well.

### Success
Tool Store recovered and investigation complete. Those energy signatures are definitely not natural. Good work! Mission complete.

### Failure
The Tool Store wasn't recovered and we still don't know what's causing the teleporter interference. Mission failed.

### Messages
string m1="Rock Monster congregation detected nearby. They seem unusually organized."
string m2="Excellent! You've found the lost Tool Store."

### TODO
- add rock monster "chappel"
- add messages noting monster congreation

### Gameplay
You need to use the cargo carrier with a lava upgrade to carry the rapid rider across the lava after you intentionally let it engulf the starting area.

## 03 Cramped Canal
cramped.dat

### Briefing
We traced the Rock Monster congregation down a narrow passage but then lost track of them. The interference is getting stronger the deeper we go.

To trace the passage further we need you to establish a strong teleporter signature by constructing a Super Teleporter. The space is extremely limited, so careful planning will be essential.

### Success
Super Teleporter constructed successfully! The signal is much clearer now. We're getting closer to the source. Mission complete.

### Failure
Without the Super Teleporter we can't penetrate deeper into the mystery. Mission failed.

### Messages
string m1="The passage ahead is too narrow for standard operations."
string m2="Clever! You've created enough space for the Super Teleporter."

### TODO
- add some crystal recharge seams

### Gameplay
build a starting base to build something that can cross lava, then dig out the other side and relocate your toolstore there, get a small driller and drill the hard rock. Then let the erosion destroy part of a building, clear the erosion and use the extra tile to squeeze in a super teleporter.

## 04 Energy Ethnography
unwilling_worker.dat

### Briefing
Using the Super Teleporter as a relay, we've located a cavern with an almost church-like structure full of Rock Monsters. Their behavior with the Energy Crystals is peculiar - sometimes they attack, sometimes they seem to retreat.

Study their behavior patterns carefully. We need to understand what drives them to attack or retreat, and collect some Energy Crystals for station upkeep if you can manage it.

### Success
Fascinating! The Rock Monsters seem to be protecting the Energy Crystals rather than simply being aggressive. When they get enough crystals, they actually retreat. That flickering rock phenomenon is also concerning. Mission complete.

### Failure
We couldn't figure out the Rock Monster behavior patterns or collect enough crystals. Mission failed.

### Messages
string m1="The Rock Monsters seem to be guarding something precious in those crystals."
string m2="Interesting! When they consume enough crystals, they disappear rather than attack."
string m3="That piece of rock just appeared out of nowhere! And now it's gone again..."

### TODO
- make more churchlike
- add "flickering" rock

### Gameplay
You need to lure rock monsters to carry energy crystals to your base without making them run away.

## 05 Lava Labyrinth
labyrinth.dat

### Briefing
That flickering rock you reported led us to trace the phenomenon further. We've discovered a whole cavern with bizarre lava flows! The lava keeps appearing and disappearing in different patterns.

Be very careful, Cadet. This cavern appears to have lava flows that shift unpredictably. Find out what's controlling these strange patterns and collect some Energy Crystals while you're there.

### Success
You navigated the shifting lava flows successfully! It's clear now that something is actively controlling the lava patterns. Mission complete.

### Failure
The shifting lava flows proved too dangerous to navigate. We still don't understand what's controlling them. Mission failed.

### Messages
- "What are these weird crystal gates? Maybe try shooting it with a laser."
- "What is that?"
- "The lava is shifting!"
- "The lava, did you do that?" / "The monsters are playing!"
- "Grrrr" (multiple monster reaction messages)

### TODO
- reinforce that the rock monsters seem to be messing with us

### Gameplay
Basically the Labyrinth board game but you're playing the rock monsters.

## 06 Dimensional Drift
dimensional_rift.dat

### Briefing
We seem to be getting closer to the source of the mystery, but two miners we sent down to explore vanished without a trace near some unusual geological formations.

We'll send you down with heavy machinery to get to the bottom of this. Find the lost miners and figure out where those strange formations lead!

### Success
Incredible! You found the miners in what appears to be a parallel dimension. This explains the teleporter interference. Mission complete.

### Failure
The lost miners weren't found and we still don't know where those formations lead. Mission failed.

### Messages
- "Nothing to see but slug holes, where could they be? Surely not in the slug tunnels?"
- "Try a different one!"
- "The recharge seam is buzzing, but nothing happens..."
- "Buzzing intensifies!"

### Gameplay
Get both vehicles on a portal (slug hole) to transport to a parallel dimension.
Solve the maze.

## 07 Monster Mansion
lights_out.dat

### Briefing
This is it, Cadet! We've located what appears to be the headquarters of the Rock Monsters. The cavern is extremely symmetrical and rich in Energy Crystals, but the walls regenerate as soon as they're drilled.

Find a way to extract those resources and finally discover the truth behind these mysterious creatures. This could be our most important mission yet!

### Success
Extraordinary! You've uncovered the truth - the Rock Monsters were never the real threat. The energy creatures you've discovered will change everything we know about this planet. Mission complete.

### Failure
We came so close to understanding the mystery, but couldn't break through their defenses. Mission failed.

### Messages
string m1="The symmetry is perfect - this is definitely artificial construction."
string m2="The walls are regenerating! There's definitely intelligence behind this."
string m3="Incredible! These aren't Rock Monsters at all - they're manifestations of something far more ancient."

### TODO
- big reveal

### Gameplay
Basically the lights out puzzle but with two types of rock.

## Reveal

U are energy creatures anchored to this world in crystal with the ability to manipulate rock
Rock monsters are merely manifestations of that ability
And actually the U were on earth and built the pyramids, seeding humanity to explore the stars decenia later
A comet with crystals was transported to earth by the very same wormhole that brought the rock raiders here
And by taking their anchor you bring them back to earth with unknown consequences
